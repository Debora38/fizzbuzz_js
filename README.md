## Fizzbuzz in Javascript
First experiment with Javascript as new language.<br>
The program checks if a number from a user input is fizz, buzz, fizzbuzz or itself as per instructions below:

_For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number<br>
For multiples of five print "Buzz"<br>
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"<br>
For the rest, print the number._<br>
